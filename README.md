## Overview
Biscord is a joke project started by UnidentifiedX in which it uses Discord's own API to create a scuffed replica of Discord's vanilla client. Sooner or later we aim to replicate
all, if not most, of the vanilla Discord client's functionality.

## Helping along
Feel free to fork the repository. Pull requests are always welcome.

## Terms of use
You may do whatever you want with the source code/application. I bear no responsibility if you choose to selfbot, which is against Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
Bot tokens may also be used with this application, but with valid intents available. Proceed at your own risk.

## Supported Platforms
### Windows
Currently, Biscord only runs on Windows as it is written in WPF which only supports compiling to Windows Executables. 

### Linux and macOS
I might get around to using Electron to make a Linux and macOS version of Biscord. This will have to wait, because this is more of a C#-orientated project.
